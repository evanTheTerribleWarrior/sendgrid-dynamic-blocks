TEST ALL SCENARIOS TO AVOID ERRORS
- Move a file/folder - SOMEHOW CANCELS THE STATE
- Export/Import File structure
- Have an "Expand all" button

Build block:
- Add Settings to allow edit styles
- Allow import of existing? It will need to read the code and reproduce the building blocks

Security:
- JWT / Auth?

Update Templates
- Fetch paged templates
- UpdateMultiple: check if HTML is empty and throw error (same in UpdateSingle)
- While updating give a Loading
- Before updating all, give final confirmation modal especially if they have selected to not create new version.
- When adding footer under Social, seems to not render in the Editor for some reason
- Check that all mandatory info is provided for example at least one template selected, otherwise do not proceed (or point it out?)


- web vitals to connect with segment/analytics?
